## Demo

After installation you can do stuff like

- **Setup**

```js
//Assign Role to a user.
user.assignRole('admin');

//assign permission to a role.
guard.init().allow('admin').to(['view', 'edit']).on('blog').commit();

//or if you like one liners
guard.allow('admin', ['view', 'edit'], 'blog');
```

- **Authorize**

by permission

```js
//view blog
user.can('view blog');

//All Actions on blog
user.can('* blog');

//view All Resources, eg. analyst
user.can('view *');

//All Action on All Resources, superadmin
user.can('*');
```

or by Role

```js
//check if user is editor
user.isA('editor');

//use isAn where you require
user.isAn('admin');

//use isAnyOf to check either of roles
user.isAnyOf(['admin', 'moderator']);
```

## Installation

[NPM page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize-guard)

```bash
npm i sequelize-guard
```

or

```bash
yarn add sequelize-guard
```

Make sure, Sequelize is setup in your project.
If not, follow Sequelize [Getting Started](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html) first.

## Usage

### Getting Started

#### Migrations

sequelize-guard will automatically register and sync needed schemas.

Or you can use following code in a migration file

```js
var SequelizeGuard = require('sequelize-guard');

module.exports = {
  up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return SequelizeGuard.migration.up(queryInterface, Sequelize, options);
  },
  down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return SequelizeGuard.migration.down(queryInterface, Sequelize, options);
  },
};
```

#### 1. Create Sequelize Object

Create sequelize object with your database configuration.

For example we have used default Sequelize setup file for models.

```js
//models/index.js

let sequelize;
if (config.use_env_variable) {
  sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env[config.use_env_variable], config);
} else {
  sequelize = new Sequelize( ... );
}
```

#### 2. Initialize Sequelize-guard

Initialize SequelizeGuard object **after** you have already initialized your models.

```js
//Import library
var SequelizeGuard = require('sequelize-guard');

...
//initialize Sequelize
...

//initialize SequelizeGuard & add to db for global use
var guard = new SequelizeGuard(sequelize, options);

db.sequelize = sequelize;
db.Sequelize = Sequelize;
db.guard = guard;  // <---------- Add this line

module.exports = db;

```

Please Note:

- Make sure you pass same same options to migration and SequelizeGuard constructor,
- If you have your own User Model implemented, make sure you pass it during initialization,
  - not required for migrations.

### Expert Mode

#### Options

```js
//defaults
{
    prefix : 'guard_',
    primaryKey : 'id',
    timestamps : false,
    paranoid : false,
    sync: true,
    debug: false,
    userModel: null,
    userPk : 'id', //User Primary Key
    safeGuardDeletes : true,
    userCache: true,
    userCacheTime: 60, // 60
}
```

- **prefix** : custom prefix for for all tables
- **primaryKey** : custom primary key for all guard tables (to be implemented) ,
- **timestamps** : _(bool | false)_, add timestamps to table
- **paranoid** : _(bool | false)_, soft deletes
- **sync**: _(bool | true)_, if set to true, database tables will be created without migrations
- **debug**: _(bool | false)_, print database queries to console.
- **userModel**: _(Sequelize Model | null)_, custom used model you want to use, instead of default User Model.
- **userPk** : _(string | 'id' )_, Primary key for User Model, in case your custom model has primaryKey other than 'id'.
- **safeGuardDeletes** : _(bool | true)_, if set to true, role or permissions can't be deleted as long as they are associated with any other data. To remove you must break all other associations (to be tested).
- **userCache** : _(bool | true)_, roles of user will be cached, this will allow faster permission resolution and less database connections.
- **userCacheTime** : _(int | 60)_, time for which roles of user will be cached (in seconds), this number should be inversely proportional to your user traffic.

## Assigning Roles and Permissions

### GuardControl API

- GuardControl is API layer over SequelizeGuard.
- Makes API calls chainable, which means you can call them in whichever order you prefer. [ exception : `commit()` ].

We are going to use same instance `guard` of SequelizeGuard we created during setup.

It's best to learn from examples. So here we will take a basic example.

```js
guard.init().allow('admin').to(['view', 'edit']).on('blog').commit();
```

(There's a one liner alternative available. Read below in SequelizeAPI)

Looks natural and easy right? Let's break the above example.

**1. init()**

To initialize an GuardControl call init() method on `guard` instance.
This function returns a brand new instance of [GuardControl](#GuardControl).

**2. allow()**

parameter : **Role** (string)

- Pass name of role for which you are making control statement.
- Currently only supports one role at time. (Planning on allowing multiple roles soon).

**Note**: If you call this multiple times, whatever you passed most recently is considered.

**3. to()**

parameter : **Action**(s) (string | array)

- accepts action as string or array of string.
- eg. view, edit, update, delete, wildcard (\*)

**4. on()**

parameter : **Resource**(s) (string | array)

- pass name of resources as string or array of strings.
- eg. blog, post, image, article, wildcard(\*)

**5. commit()**

Asynchronous call which saves all the data provided in database, using magic of SequelizeGuard and Sequelize.

- If permission is already created before, same permission is used.
- If Role is already created same role is assigned permission given.

**Returns** : object with properties roles, permission.
All the roles and permissions specified (created or old) by this GuardControl statement are returned.

### User Model API

SequelizeGuard adds some api calls to User Model that you provide in options. So you can assign roles straight from your user object that is logged in.

- user.assignRole
- user.assignRoles
- user.rmAssignedRoles

### SequelizeGuard API

for handling permissions

- createPerms
- createPermsBulk
- findPerms

**for handling roles**

- makeRole
- makeRoles
- deleteRoles
- allRoles
- getRole
- findRoles

**for associations between user/role/permission**

- allow : GuardControl in one line
- addPermsToRole
- rmPermsFromRole
- assignRoles
- rmAssignedRoles

For More information check SequelizeGuard [API Reference](https://sequelizeguard.web.app/api).

## Authorization

### User API

#### Permission based Authorization

##### user.can()

parameter : 'action resource' (string)
returns : bool

Pass permission you are testing for as follows. returns true if allowed.

```js
//view blogs
user.can('view blogs');

//All Actions on blogs
user.can('* blogs');

//view All Resources, eg. analyst
user.can('view *');

//All Action on All Resources, superadmin
user.can('*');
```

#### Role based authorization

You can use following methods to have perform role based authorization.

- user.isAllOf(roles)
- user.isAnyOf(roles)
- user.isA(role)
- user.isAn(role)

For More information check SequelizeGuard [API Reference](https://sequelizeguard.web.app/api/).

### Events

You can listen to following events. They can be helpful for logging or updating user cache

- **onRolesCreated** : with created roles
- **onRolesDeleted** : with data of deleted roles
- **onPermsCreated** : with created permissions
- **onPermsAddedToRole** : with data after permissions added
- **onPermsRemovedFromRole** : with data after permissions are removed

## Road map

- Make seeders better, see branch [dev-seeder](https://github.com/lotivo/sequelize-guard/blob/dev-seeder/README.md) for progress.
- Implement "allow except" kind of permissions.
- Role priority, which will allow to do things like
  - `user.atleast('admin')`
  - `user.atmost('admin')`

## Influences

- Spaties's Laravel-permission, Authorization Library for Laravel.
- Node-ACL for Node.js

## Alternative

- Node-ACL is versatile library which has support for most ORMs.
  I actually tried to use that before writing this, but somehow wasn't feeling the power or freedom I wanted. But it is quite popular and mostly used.
